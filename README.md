# MetaTerm

â€¦is a _prompt like_ user interface enabling running multiple terminal applications at the same time while preserving the sequence of execution. This functionality is controllable in a _vim like_ way in respect of both keybindings and a mode based paradigm.

_MetaTerm_ is implemented in _QML_ and uses [QMLTermWidget](https://github.com/Swordfish90/qmltermwidget) as its embedded terminal emulator.
